> ### The Key Points
> H-score is our first step introducing neural network based methods to compute [modal decomposition](https://gilearning.github.io/ModalDecomposition/) from data. It is a loss metric used in the training of neural networks in a specific configuration. The result is approximately equivalent as a conventional end-to-end neural network with cross entropy loss, with the additional benefit of allowing direct controls of the chosen feature functions. This can be useful in applications with known structures or constraints of feature functions. Conceptually, the use of H-score networks turns the design focus onto functional operations, and serves as a stepping stone for the solutions to more complex problems.
